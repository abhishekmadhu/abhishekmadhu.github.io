		<h2>This Is The Corporate Ipsum</h2>

Organically grow the holistic world view of disruptive innovation via workplace diversity and empowerment.</p>

		<p class="blog">Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.</p>

		<h2>Samuel L. Jackson Ipsum</h2>

		<p class="first-para-of-each-blog blog">You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out.</p> 

		<p class="blog">Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

		<p class="blog">Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

		<h2>This Is My First Article - Riker Ipsum</h2>

		<p class="first-para-of-each-blog blog">My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? What? We're not at all alike! Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? This should be interesting.</p> 

		<p class="blog">Travel time to the nearest starbase? I am your worst nightmare! I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Computer, belay that order. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Your head is not an artifact! Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training.</p>

		<p class="blog">Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Damage report! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself.</p>
